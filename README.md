# How to use this script to calculate strategy hours
I wrote this script to find out the number of billable hours the Strategy team at 18F is clocking each week. I did this mainly to practice my R programming skills, but also because while there is an existing Python script that calculates the same thing, I don't know Python. 

More soon.
